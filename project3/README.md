CHISME 

My app is a blogging site to upload random photos and captions 

The inspo for this app is like a twitter, insta, myspace kinda application. I wanted to make an app where people can just post whatever they want and are able to share it with others.

The layout is simple for now. There is a sign up / login page. If you don't have an account you can still look at posts from other users, but you aren't able to make a post. If you do have an account you can make posts and edit them. For both you are able to click on post images / captions and can go to a seperate page that it just with that post

Technologies I used are:
date-fns, multer, react-quill, cookie-parser, react-router-dom, react-bootstrap, mongoose, bycrptjs, cors, 

Some outstanding bugs are
